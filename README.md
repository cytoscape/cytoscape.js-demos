Some introductory demos for cytoscape.js

* **addNodeEdgeFit**: three ways to add nodes to a cy canvas: at init time, from a button, by direct clicks
* **importFromCy3**: 2 files exported from Cy3, the network (with node positions) and the vizmap.  for expedience (there will often be better ways) each is minimally made into a javascript file by adding one line at the top.  This allows easy import of the two data structures into the web page where simple cytoscape.js commands will load and display the network created in Cy3

A more complete explanation will be added soon.
